OPERATING SYSTEM FUNCTION - SECURITY
One of the main functions of an operating system is security. An operating system typically lets the user set up an administrative account. 
An administrative account lets one user have access to all files stored on the computer. It also lets the administrator delegate 
permissions such as file access and network access for other user accounts.
